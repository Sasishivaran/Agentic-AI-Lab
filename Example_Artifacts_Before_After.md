# 📄 Example Portfolio Artifact — Before & After

This example shows how a raw student project can be transformed into a professional, hiring-ready portfolio artifact.

---

## ❌ BEFORE — Raw Student Project

**Title:** Chatbot Project  
**Description:**  
“I built a chatbot using an API. It answers questions and sometimes summarizes text.”

**README Issues:**  
- No architecture  
- No evaluation metrics  
- No governance  
- No reproducibility instructions

## ✅ AFTER — Professional Architect Portfolio Artifact

### **Project Title:**  
Autonomous Multi-Agent Customer Support System

### **Design-First Write-Up (The Why)**  
This system uses a Reflection Loop and a Supervisor Agent to coordinate retrieval, reasoning, and response generation. A single-agent approach was rejected due to inconsistent outputs and lack of controllability. The multi-agent pattern improved reliability and reduced latency variance by 18%.

### **Evaluation Metrics**  
- RAGAS Score: 0.87  
- Latency: 420ms  
- Cost-per-task: $0.0021  
- Hallucination Rate: Reduced by 32%  

### **Reproducibility README (The How)**  
- Includes environment setup  
- Placeholder architecture diagram  
- Governance (LlamaGuard, rate limiting, audit logging)  
- Installation + usage instructions  
- Clear project structure  

This is the standard learners should aim for.
